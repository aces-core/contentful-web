## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ“„ Creating Contentful API and CMA Tokens
To connect your ACES Contentful Web project to Contentful, youâ€™ll need two tokens:

1. API Access Token (CDA Token) â€” for reading content from Contentful.

2. CMA Access Token (CMA Token) â€” for managing content and performing administrative tasks (like content updates).

**Step 1: Log into Contentful**
Go to Contentful and log into your account.

**Step 2: Create the Tokens**
1. API Access Token (CDA Token)
    - Navigate to Settings > API keys in the Contentful dashboard.
    - Click Add API Key.
    - Choose an appropriate environment (usually master).
    - Under Access tokens, youâ€™ll see your CDA Token (API token). Copy it.

2. CMA Access Token (CMA Token)
    - Navigate to Settings > API keys.
    - Scroll down to Content Management API.
    - Click Add API Key under Content Management API.
    - Copy the CMA Token generated here.

### ðŸ“¦ Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikepalazzo/aces-contentful-web.git
   cd aces-contentful-web
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the environment variables file and configure:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then open the .env file in your editor and update the following values with your own to connect to your Contentful Space:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_GRAPHQL_URL=https://graphql.contentful.com/content/v1/spaces
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_SPACE=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_ENVIRONMENT=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_ACCESS_TOKEN=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN=
    NEXT_CF_CMA_TOKEN=
4. Create Your Contentful Site
    The following command will create your initial contentful site.
    The CMA Token is required for any contentful space management through the starter commands.
     ```bash
    npm run create-cf-site My Site
    ```
5. Start the dev server:
     ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6. Run Storybook:
